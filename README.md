ðŸ§  Competitive Programming Journey
Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository.

This repo is where I document my long-term journey to reach Candidate Master (Codeforces rating 1900â€“2000). Itâ€™s an ambitious goal â€” most people either burn out or never get close â€” but Iâ€™m taking a slow, methodical path over the next 3â€“5 years to get there. My strategy is simple: solve problems daily, review patterns deeply, and focus on long-term mastery over quick wins.

ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Studying
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building a rock-solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving patterns. My study path includes:

Core problem-solving patterns like:

Sliding Window

Two Pointers

Fast & Slow Pointers

Hash Maps

Binary Search

Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs

Weekly practice from NeetCode, LeetCode, and Codeforces contests

Focused deep work blocks using timers and spaced repetition to retain problem types and edge case patterns

Occasional writeups and breakdowns of tougher problems I solve

Over time, Iâ€™ll also revisit core math topics like number theory, combinatorics, and modular arithmetic â€” anything that frequently shows up in mid-to-high level CP contests.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Iâ€™m Doing This
Iâ€™m not doing this for clout or credentials. Iâ€™m doing this because I want to become dangerous at solving hard problems â€” under pressure, under time, and under constraints. CP is the best environment Iâ€™ve found to sharpen that edge.

ðŸ‘‹ If You're Here
If youâ€™re also on the CP grind, feel free to explore the repo. Iâ€™ll be uploading solutions, notes, and key resources as I go. If this helps even one person avoid the confusion I went through early on, thatâ€™s a win.

Letâ€™s get after it.
