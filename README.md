Welcome to my Competitive Programming Repo.

This repo is to document everything I am doing in attempting to developing a career in competitive programming. My long term goal of becoming a "Candidate Master" on CodeForces which is a ranking of "1900-2000".

This goal is insane, and most people as always think I am nuts for going after this but I believe I can do it with 3-5 years of diligent practice and daily deep work on problem solving.

The main reason I want to try and excel at CP is to increase likleyhood of job oppurtunities when I attempt to grow a career in AI Quant Development. Having a CP score and being able to solve problems at the top level showcases that you are a top player in the industry.

Anyways, enjoy this repo, if you are someone also trying to get better at CP I hope this repo helps you with some resources.
